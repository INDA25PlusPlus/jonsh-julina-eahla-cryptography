Open two terminals and enter 'cd cryptography'.

In the first terminal, enter 'cargo run --bin server'
In the second terminal, enter 'cargo run --bin client'

The client-terminal will now wait for user inputs.

To encrypt a file located in /example-files, enter its name including extension .txt


We use aes-gcm because it handles encryption and signing all at once.
